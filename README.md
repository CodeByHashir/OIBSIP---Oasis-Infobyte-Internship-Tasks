# Summer Internship Projects At OIBSIP

## Overview

Welcome to my Summer Internship repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the projects I will be working on during my summer internship. The goal of these projects is to boost my skills and learning experience in various areas of data science and machine learning.

## Repository Structure

This repository will contain all the related content for my internship projects, including project files with proper names and documentation. The structure of the repository is organized as follows:


## Projects

### Project 1: Iris Flower Classification
- **Description**: This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species based on the dimensions of their sepals and petals.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Objective**: To apply and hone skills in data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

### Project 2: Car Price Prediction
- **Description**: Predicting the price of used cars based on various attributes such as age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Objective**: To understand and implement regression modeling techniques.

### Project 2: Unemployment Analysis
- **Description**: This project involves analyzing unemployment data to identify trends and patterns using various data analysis techniques.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Objective**: The objective of this project is to gain insights into unemployment trends, identify key factors affecting unemployment rates, and visualize the data to better understand the underlying patterns and relationships.




4. **Explore the Notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data analysis and model development:
