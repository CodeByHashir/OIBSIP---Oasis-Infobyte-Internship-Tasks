# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on the dimensions of their sepals and petals. This is a classic problem in machine learning and data science, and it provides a great opportunity to apply and hone skills in data analysis, visualization, and modeling.


## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset that consists of 150 observations of iris flowers. Each observation includes four features: 
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The dataset is labeled, and the labels correspond to the three species of iris flowers:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the dataset and visualize relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.
3. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify Iris flowers.
4. **Results Interpretation**: Interpret the results and validate the modelâ€™s performance.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using `pip`. 
Also we use jupyter NoteBook for this project, you can also use Google colab which is free and available online.
