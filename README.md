# Summer Internship Projects At OIBSIP

## Overview

Welcome to my Summer Internship repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the projects I will be working on during my summer internship. The goal of these projects is to boost my skills and learning experience in various areas of data science and machine learning.

## Repository Structure

This repository will contain all the related content for my internship projects, including project files with proper names and documentation. The structure of the repository is organized as follows:


## Projects

### Project 1: Iris Flower Classification
- **Description**: This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species based on the dimensions of their sepals and petals.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Objective**: To apply and hone skills in data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

### Project 2: Car Price Prediction
- **Description**: Predicting the price of used cars based on various attributes such as age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Objective**: To understand and implement regression modeling techniques.

### Project 3: Unemployment Analysis
- **Description**: This project involves analyzing unemployment data to identify trends and patterns using various data analysis techniques.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Objective**: The objective of this project is to gain insights into unemployment trends, identify key factors affecting unemployment rates, and visualize the data to better understand the underlying patterns and relationships.

### Project 4: Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting sales figures based on advertising expenditures across different media channels using the Advertising.csv dataset.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Objective**: The objective of this project is to build regression models to predict sales and analyze the impact of TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising on sales. The project helps in understanding the importance of data-driven decisions in optimizing marketing strategies.

### Project 5: Email Spam Detection
- **Description**: This project focuses on identifying and classifying emails as spam or ham using machine learning algorithms.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook
- **Objective**: The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately detect spam emails by analyzing their content and metadata. This project helps in understanding the practical applications of NLP and machine learning in text classification tasks.

**Explore the Notebooks**:
